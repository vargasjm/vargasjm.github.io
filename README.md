html in progress


just junk i made while learning stuff on my own

1. firstSampleNun--
          first website made with HTML Dog. Named after the nun image. Basic layout with notes and messy stuff.
          haven't figured out the form action linking on github. 'feed.html' as an action placeholder in the form
          worked offline but not on github pages. 
2. QualfiedSurvey-- 
          Are you qualified for some vague thing judged on 4 questions? Based off of https://codepen.io/amyfu/pen/oLChg. 
          Each answer is weighted 1-3, max score is 12 with minimum of 3. Minimum, low-mid, high-mid, and max score have
          different answers. Basic format of a survey. First example using JavaScript. I spent a long time trying to figure
          out why the JS wasn't working until I remembered that HTML wasn't case-sensitive while JS is. It was really just a 
          few tiny things. ID versus Id sucks. Might add selected answers to be like picture cards, like Buzzfeed style. Also 
          have to find out how to link different HTML files together on github, maybe a menu? Also, start looking into 
          different formatting on different devices as well as that whole CSS floatbox thing.
